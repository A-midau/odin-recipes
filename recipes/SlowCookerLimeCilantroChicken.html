    <h3>This tender and flavorful chicken is a breeze to prepare in your slow cooker. Bursting with the bright flavors of lime and cilantro, it's a versatile protein perfect for tacos, salads, or simply served over rice.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar salsa</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package dry taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 medium lime, juiced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
<li><strong>Combine flavors:</strong> In your slow cooker, mix together salsa, taco seasoning, lime juice, and cilantro until well blended.</li> 
<li><strong>Cook chicken:</strong> Add the chicken thighs to the slow cooker and spoon the salsa mixture over the chicken to coat.</li>
<li><strong>Slow cook:</strong> Cover and cook on Low for 6-8 hours, or on High for 4 hours, until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. An internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) is safe.</li>
<li><strong>Shred and serve:</strong> Shred the cooked chicken using two forks and mix it back into the sauce. Serve as desired.</li>
</ol>
 <h3><strong>Tip:</strong> For a spicier kick, choose a salsa with a higher heat level.</h3>
